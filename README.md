👋 Hi, I’m @0Farah0

👀 I’m interested in:
1. Exploring how AI can detect and prevent cyber threats, from advanced malware to phishing attacks.
2. Creating new applications and tools that leverage AI to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.
3. Keeping up with the latest advancements in AI and exploring new techniques and methodologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
1. Diving deep into generative AI, reinforcement learning, and large language models.
I'm particularly interested in exploring how these technologies can revolutionize education and cybersecurity.
2. Understanding the implications of AI on society and ensuring it's developed and used responsibly.
3. Keeping up with the rapid pace of innovation in the AI field.
From TensorFlow to PyTorch and beyond, the tools that can help me solve complex problems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
1. Projects that push the boundaries of AI and cybersecurity integration. Think Skynet with manners.
2. Open-source learning resources that make tech education accessible to everyone. Knowledge is power, folks!
3. Anything that involves using my mad Tableau skills to make data sing (yes, data can sing, trust me).

📫 How to reach me: You already found me here! But if you're feeling social, hit me on LinkedIn (link in the contact section, duh).

⚡ Fun fact: I once used SPSS to predict the best flavor of ice cream for a summer party. Turns out, it's ALWAYS mint chocolate chip. Don't fight science.
